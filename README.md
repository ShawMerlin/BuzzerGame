# BuzzerGame

I modified the below Amazon Buzzers with my own 3 color LED board and Arduino Uno R3 Hat to run them. <br> <br>

The Buttons X LED's will be blue until someone hits one, the one hit will turn Green while the other will turn red <br>
They will stay in this state until the Clear Button is pressed. <br>
This also uses the buzzer from the original game to buzz when they are selected. <br>
Modification of the original button is needed. <br> <br>
